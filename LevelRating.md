# How to get your levels rated :D
there are many ways your level can get rated in my gdps,
some of them are:

# Well decorated levels
Try to decorate your level (even if it's a layout) to
increase the possibility for it to get rated :)
### Remember!
Don't make levels too easy or too hard or it won't be rated

# Layouts
Yes they can be rated too :3

Well synchronized layouts with good deco are a good combo
for a layout to be rated. Just remember, don't make them too
hard or to easy!

## Have fun!
Now: go have fun creating your levels in the online tab
:D

### note:
creator points or cp may arrive late because i need
to use a cron tool in my gdps manager so dont open any ticket for
this reason!)
